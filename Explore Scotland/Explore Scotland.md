 ## Country ##
Scotland is a great place to be a doctor with lots of opportunity to pursue the kind of career and lifestyle that suits you as an individual. We've a rich vibrant culture, beautiful countryside, every kind of sports and leisure activity and some lovely people too (if we do say so ourselves). It's so good we've had to invent rain and midgies to stop the rest of the world from emptying.
 
## Culture ##
Scotland is home of bag-piping, Arts festivals and the world's biggest Hogmanay. It's the birthplace of Burns, Walter Scott, Conan Doyle, Irving Welsh, Robert Louis Stevenson, Muriel Spark and a host of others and has been an inspiration for writers, poets, artists, conposers and filmakers from all over the world. 

Distinctive in its own right but with long-standing and strong links with world-culture Scotland is a thoroughly cultured place to live. Scotland is a place where you can go from dancing highland dances that were first recorded in the 1400s to singing karoke in Mandarin in the space of a single evening. 

## Sport and outdoor pursuits ##
If you like golf, we have some of the best courses in the world. We've had several hundred years to perfect the art of course design, after all. Football (https://www.nls.uk/news/archive/2006/06/modern-football---invented-in-scotland!) and rugby are quite popular too but you can try shinty, American football, cricket or even Kibaddi (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland_national_kabaddi_team). We have some decent tennis players too.

If you like outdoor pursuits, you're never far from hills, mountains, lochs and sea wherever you are in Scotland. Kayaking, hill-walking, climbing, mountain-biking and sailing are all as popular as they are accessible.

# Food and drink
And after all the hill-walking and culture, we've some of best food and drink in the world too. Scottish seafood, meat and produce are all world-class, though porridge and haggis are an acquired tast for some. We do something really quite special with our barley too.  
 
## Community and History ##
With tombs and settlements older than the pyramids, castles and towers that reflect a sometimes troubled past,
Scotland has a rich lengthy and legendary history. We've been welcoming, and trading ideas with the world for centuries
and continue to be a cosmopolitan and connected place to be, with communities of Scots who've come from all points
of the compass. NHSScotland is a product of our community spirit and we put patients at the centre of what we do.
