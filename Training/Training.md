## Training as a GP ##

The purpose of the General Practice Specialty Training Programme is to produce a GP who is capable of working independently in Primary Care in a variety of settings.  During the three or four years you will acquire the capability to identify your strengths, areas that require development and understand the importance of self-development and lifelong learning.  These skills are acquired by a combination of clinical experience and both formal and informal teaching.

GP training programmes in Scotland are arranged in 4 regions, East, West, North and South East.

There are 18 GP training programmes across Scotland with approx 1000 trainees in both hospital and general practice settings.
